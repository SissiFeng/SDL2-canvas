Summary of Implementation

1. SDL2 API Client (sdl2_client.py)
Handles communication with SDL2 API endpoints
Manages task creation, status checking, and result retrieval
Implements waiting for task completion with timeout
2. Unit Operations (unit_operations.py)
Defines handlers for different SDL2 operations (CV, rolling mean, peak detection)
Maps Canvas parameters to SDL2 API parameters
Implements a factory pattern for creating operation instances
3. Workflow Executor (workflow_executor.py)
Parses Canvas workflow JSON files
Executes operations in sequence
Resolves dependencies between operations
Saves results to a file
4. Data Handler (data_handler.py)
Handles CSV data upload and retrieval
Converts between CSV and pandas DataFrame formats
Extracts and saves CSV content from task results
5. Configuration (config.py)
Manages configuration settings through environment variables
Provides defaults for all settings
6. Example Workflows
Simple CV workflow
Peak detection workflow
Data processing workflow with multiple operations
7. Main Entry Point (main.py)
Provides a command-line interface for executing workflows
Handles command-line arguments and error reporting

How It Works
1. The user creates a workflow JSON file that defines a sequence of operations.
2. The workflow executor loads the workflow file and executes each operation in sequence.
3. For each operation, the executor:
Resolves any dependencies on previous operations
Creates the appropriate unit operation handler
Executes the operation by calling the SDL2 API
Waits for the operation to complete
Stores the result for use by subsequent operations
4. After all operations are complete, the executor saves the final result to a file.

Next Steps
Testing: Create unit tests for each component to ensure they work correctly.
Error Handling: Improve error handling and reporting.
Documentation: Add more detailed documentation for each component.
Logging: Enhance logging to provide more detailed information about execution.
Security: Implement authentication and authorization for API calls.
